BanBuilder is a PHP package for profanity filtering. The PHP script uses regex to intelligently look for "leetspeak"-style numeric or symbol replacements.

Installing
-------
To install BanBuilder, simply include it in your projects's `composer.json`. 

	"snipe/banbuilder": "dev-master",

There are no additional dependencies required for this package to work.

Usage
-------

Please see the [official package website](https://banbuilder.com) for full usage details.

Summary
-------
In a nutshell, this code takes an array of bad words and compares it to an array of common filter-evasion tactics. It then does a string replacement to insert regex parameters into your badwords array, and then evaluates your input string to that expanded banned word list.

So in your bad words array, you might have:

     [0] => 'ass'

The `preg_replace` functions replace all of the possible shenaningan letters with regex patterns (in lieu of adding the variants onto the end of the array), so the 'ass' in your array gets turned into this, right before the `preg_replace` checks for matches:

     [0] => /(a|a\.|a\-|4|@|Á|á|À|Â|à|Â|â|Ä|ä|Ã|ã|Å|å|α)(s|s\.|s\-|5|\$|§)(s|s\.|s\-|5|\$|§)/i

This means that a word can have none, one or any variety of leet replacements and it will still trip the trigger. Part of the leet filter includes stripping out letter-dash and letter-dots.

This means that the following all evaluate to the "bitch":

- B1tch
- bi7tch
- b.i.t.c.h.
- b-i-t-c-h
- b.1.t.c.h.
- ßitch
- and so on....
