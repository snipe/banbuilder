        <h3>BOO Censorship!</h3>
		<p>I hate censorship as much as anyone, but as a web application developer, 
		there are times when a banned-word list is necessary, especially if the 
		application or site is geared towards younger users or corporate environments.</p>
		
		<h3>What This Script Does</h3>
		<p>The script will take a 
		word or phrase and replace the words you put in the <code>$badwords</code> array and replace it with asterisks. </p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Case insensitive</li>
			<li>Looks for &quot;leetspeak&quot;-style combinations of foreign characters, numbers and symbols</li>
			<li>Uses regex, so your badword list stays short</li>
			<li>Uses asterisks as the replacement, but you can specify your own character
			<li>Add as many bad words as you like</li>
		</ul>

		<p>I haven't finished all of the leetspeak filters yet, 
		but I have a good start so far.  If you wish to twiddle those to add or remove, they can be found in the 
		<code>censor.function.php</code> file in the master branch, in the <code>$leet_replace</code> array.</p>
		
		<h3>How to Get It?</h3>
		<p>Just click on the tar.gz or .zip icons above to download the files. Or 
		if you prefer, you can clone the repo: </p>
		
		<pre><code>$ git clone git@github.com:snipe/banbuilder.git</code></pre>	


		<h3>Quickstart</h3>
		<p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/snipe/banbuilder/blob/master/README.md">README</a> in 
		the repo to get started. It's as simple as including two files and invoking a function. </p>
		
     include('wordlist-regex.php');
     include('censor.function.php');
     $censored = censorString($input, $badwords); 
		
		<h3>Important!</h3>
		<p>The included example doesn't use any user-submitted data escaping, since I did't want my example to 
		interfere with the data cleansing you might be doing. This filter does not protect you against XSS or 
		SQL injection attacks, and never will, as that it not its purpose. Read up on PDO, 
		<code>mysql_real_escape_string()</code>, the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/filter.filters.sanitize.php">built-in 
		PHP sanitizing filters</a>, and <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Data_Validation">OWASP's guidelines 
		for data validation</a> for more on this. </p>

		
		<h3>The Profanity Filter Conundrum</h3>
		<p>No banned-word list is going to be 
		flawless. A G-rated list will block out the word "screw", but there are certainly 
		legitimate uses for the word "screw". </p>

		<p>The word &quot;Dick&quot; can be a crude reference to male genitalia, or to the 
		nickname of a fellow named Richard. Context is the only way to tell the difference, and it's 
		been argued that one cannot censor a language without actually comprehending it, 
		since context is so critical. </p>
		
		<p>If you put &quot;ass&quot; in your bad word array, legitimate words like 
		&quot;class&quot; will be turned into &quot;cl***&quot;, so choose your words wisely. This, 
		and a lack of context-understanding, is a limitation of profanity filters in general and it isn't unique to 
		this one. It is possible to create a whitelist of words on top of your blacklist, to specify 
		legitimate words that might have an exactly matching swear word within it (like "assign", "classy", etc), 
		but the creation and maintenance of that list would impractical, and running every string 
		through it could increase processing time considerably. </p>
		
		<h4>I want to stick my long-necked Giraffe up your fluffy white bunny</h4>
		<p><strong>In general, profanity filters just don't work.</strong> At least not the way we want them to. </p>
		<blockquote>"Obscenity filtering is an enduring, maybe even timeless problem. 
		I'm doubtful it will ever be possible to solve this particular problem through 
		code alone. But it seems some companies and developers can't stop tilting at 
		that windmill. Which means you might want to think twice 
		before you move to Scunthorpe.<br> - 
		<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/10/obscenity-filters-bad-idea-or-incredibly-intercoursing-bad-idea.html">Jeff Atwood</a> </blockquote>
		
		<p>And let's not forget that there are LOTS of ways to say horribly offensive, 
		degrading and disrespectful things without ever using a single profane word. Check out 
		this <a href="http://habitatchronicles.com/2007/03/the-untold-history-of-toontowns-speedchat-or-blockchattm-from-disney-finally-arrives/">fantastic 
		article on Habitat Chronicles</a> for more.</p>
		
		<p>But of course, there are times when we need to give a good best-effort. </p>

		<p>And although this script makes a good effort at trying to block most attempts to get around filters by 
		using special characters, adding dots or dashes in between letters, etc - someone who is 
		really determined <i>will</i> find a way around whatever profanity filter you use. You should possibly consider 
		including a flag or report function into your application so that you can take punitive action against 
		people who are consistently trying to break the rules.
